                            <p>Whereas:</p>

                                        <p> (1) Council Directive 90/219/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms<a id="ntc3-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0003"> (<span >3</span>)</a> has been substantially amended several times<a id="ntc4-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0004"> (<span >4</span>)</a>. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.</p>
                                        <p> (2) Under the Treaty, action by the Community relating to the environment must be based on the principle that preventive action is to be taken and must have as its objective, among other things, the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment and 
                                        <p> (3) Measures concerning the evaluation and best use of biotechnology with regard to the environment are a priority area on which Community action should concentrate.</p>
                                    
                                  
                                        <p> (4) The development of biotechnology is such as to contribute to the economic expansion of the Member States. This involves the use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs) in operations of </p>
                                    
                                        <p>(5) The contained use of GMMs should be such as to limit their possible negative consequences for human health and the environment, due attention being given to the prevention of accidents and the control of waste.</p>
                                     
                                        <p>(6) GMMs which are disposed of without appropriate provisions for specific containment measures to limit their contact with the general population and the environment do not fall within the scope of this Directive. Other Community legislation such as Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms<a id="ntc5-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0005"> (<span >5</span>)</a> may apply.</p>
                                   
                                        <p> (7) Micro-organisms, if released into the environment in one Member State in the course of their contained use, may reproduce and spread, crossing national frontiers and thereby affecting other Member States.</p>
                                 
                                        <p>(8) In order to bring about the safe development of biotechnology throughout the Community, it is necessary to establish common measures for the evaluation and reduction of the potential risks arising in the course of all operations involving the contained use of GMMs and to set appropriate conditions of use.
                                 
                                        <p>(9) The precise nature and scale of risks associated with the contained use of GMMs are not yet fully known and the risk involved must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In order to evaluate the risk to human health and the environment, it is necessary to lay down requirements for risk assessment.</p>
                                  
                                        <p>(10) Contained uses of GMMs should be classified in relation to the risks they present to human health and the environment. Such classification should be in line with international practice and based on an assessment of the risk.</p>
                                    
                                        <p> (11) In order to ensure a high level of protection, the containment and other protective measures applied to a contained use must correspond to the classification of the contained use. Where there is any uncertainty, the appropriate containment and other protective measures for the higher classification should be applied until less stringent measures are justified by appropriate </p>
                                     
                                        <p>(12 For all activities involving GMMs the principles of good microbiological practice and good occupational safety and hygiene should apply in accordance with relevant Community legislation.</p>
                                  
                                        <p>(13) Appropriate containment measures should be applied at the various stages of an operation to control emissions and the disposal of material from contained (
                                        <p>(14) Any person, before undertaking for the first time the contained use of a GMM in a particular installation, should forward a notification to the competent authority so that the authority may satisfy itself that the proposed installation is appropriate for the purposes of carrying out the activity in a manner that does not present a hazard to human health and the 
                                        <p>(15) It is also necessary to establish appropriate procedures for the case-by-case notification of specific operations involving the contained use of GMMs, taking account of the degree of risk involved.</p>
                                     
                                        <p>(16) In the case of operations involving high risk, the consent of the competent authority should be given.
                                        <p>(17) The containment and other protective measures applied to contained uses should be reviewed periodically.</p>
                                    
                                        <p> (18) It may be considered appropriate to consult the public on the contained use of GMMs.</p>
                                    
                                        <p> (19) People employed in contained uses should be consulted in accordance with the requirements of relevant Community legislation, in particular Directive 2000/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work (seventh individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)<a id="ntc6-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0006"> (<span >6</span>)</a>.</p>
                                   
                                        <p>(20) Appropriate measures should be taken to inform any person liable to be affected by an accident on all matters relating to safety.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(21) Emergency plans should be established to deal effectively with accidents.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(22) If an accident occurs, the user should immediately inform the competent authority and communicate the information necessary for assessing the impact of that accident and for taking the appropriate action.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(23) It is appropriate for the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, to establish a procedure for the exchange of information on accidents and for the Commission to set up a register of such accidents.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(24) The contained use of GMMs throughout the Community should be monitored, and to this end Member States should supply certain information to the Commission.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(25) In order to be considered safe for human health and the environment, GMMs should meet the list of criteria as defined in Annex II, Part B. To take account of the pace at which biotechnology is advancing, the nature of the criteria to be developed and the limited scope of that list, it is appropriate for the Council to revise those criteria, which should, where necessary, be supplemented by guidance notes to facilitate their application.</p>
                                     
                                        <p> (26) this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission<a id="ntc7-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2009125EN.01007501-E0007"> (<span >7</span>)</a>.</p>
                                     
                                  
                                        <p>(27) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the amendments necessary to adapt Annexes II, III, IV and V to technical progress, and to adapt Annex II, Part C. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(28) The new elements introduced into this Directive concern only the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.</p>
                                     
                                        <p>(29) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex VI, Part B,</p>

                            <p>1.   Member States shall ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the contained use of GMMs.</p>
                            <p>2.   To that end, the user shall carry out an assessment of the contained uses as regards the risks to human health and the environment that those contained uses may pose, using as a minimum the elements of assessment and the procedure set out in Annex III, Sections A and B.</p>
                            <p>3.   The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall result in the final classification of the contained uses in four classes applying the procedure set out in Annex III, which will result in the assignment of containment levels in accordance with Article 5:</p>
                           
                                        <p>Class 1:</p>
                                        <p>activities of no or negligible risk, that is to say activities for which level 1 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</p>		   
                                        <p>Class 2:</p>
                                    
                                        <p>activities of low risk, that is to say activities for which level 2 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</p>
                                   
                                        <p>Class 3:</p>
                                   
                                        <p>activities of moderate risk, that is to say activities for which level 3 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</p>
                                     
                                        <p>Class 4:</p>
                                   
                                        <p>activities of high risk, that is to say activities for which level 4 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</p>
                                     
                            <p>4.   Where there is doubt as to which class is appropriate for the proposed contained use, the more stringent protective measures shall be applied unless, by agreement with the competent authority, there is sufficient evidence to justify the application of less stringent measures.</p>
                            <p>5.   The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall especially take into account the question of disposal of waste and effluents. Where appropriate, the safety measures needed in order to protect human health and the environment shall be implemented.</p>
                            <p>6.   A record of the assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall be kept by the user and made available in an appropriate form to the competent authority as part of the notification pursuant to Articles 6, 8 and 9 or on request.</p>
                           

                            <div align="center"><i><p>Article 5</p></i></div>
                            <p>1.   Save to the extent that point 2 of Annex IV allows other measures to be applied, the user shall apply the general principles and the appropriate containment and other protective measures set out in Annex IV corresponding to the class of the contained use, so as to keep workplace and environmental exposure to any GMMs to the lowest reasonably practicable level, and so that a high level of safety is ensured.</p>
                            <p>2.   The assessment referred to in Article 4(2) and the containment and other protective measures applied shall be reviewed periodically, and forthwith if:</p>

                            <p>Following the notification referred to in Article 6, subsequent class 1 contained use may proceed without further notification. Users of GMMs in class 1 contained uses shall be required to keep the record of each assessment referred to in Article 4(6), which shall be made available to the competent authority on request.</p>
                            

                            <div align="center"><i><p>Article 8</p></i></div>
                            <p>1.   For first and subsequent class 2 contained uses to be carried out in premises notified in accordance with Article 6, a notification containing the information listed in Annex V, Part B shall be submitted.</p>
                            <p>2.   If the premises have been the subject of a previous notification to carry out class 2 or a higher class of contained uses and any associated consent requirements have been satisfied, the class 2 contained use may proceed immediately following the new notification.</p>
                            <p>However, the applicant may himself request from the competent authority a decision on the grant of a formal authorisation. The decision must be made within a maximum of 45 days from the notification.</p>

                            <p>1.   Member States shall designate the authority or authorities competent to implement the measures which they adopt in application of this Directive and to receive and acknowledge the notifications referred to in Articles 6, 8 and 9.</p>
                            <p>2.   The competent authorities shall examine the conformity of the notifications with the requirements of this Directive, the accuracy and completeness of the information given, the correctness of the assessment referred to in Article 4(2) and the class of contained uses and, where appropriate, the suitability of the containment and other protective measures, the waste management, and emergency response measures.</p>

                               </p>
                               <p>Types of GMMs listed in Part C in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 20(2) are excluded from the scope of this Directive. GMMs will be added to the list on a case-by-case basis and exclusion will relate only to each clearly identified GMM. This exclusion applies only when the GMM is used under conditions of contained use as defined in point (c) of Article 2. It does not apply to the deliberate release of GMMs. For a GMM to be listed in Part C, it must be proved that it meets the criteria given below.</p>
                               <p>2.   <span>General criteria</span>
                               </p>
                               <p>2.1.   Strain verification/authentication</p>
                               <p >Identity of the strain must be precisely established. Modification must be known and verified.</p>
                               <p>2.2.   Documented and established evidence of safety</p>
                               <p>Documented evidence of the safety of the organism must be provided.</p>
                               <p>2.3.   Genetic stability</p>
                               <p>Where any instability could adversely affect safety, evidence of stability is required.</p>
                               <p>3.   <span>Specific criteria</span>
                               </p>
                               <p>3.1.   Non-pathogenic</p>
                               <p>The GMM should not be capable of causing disease or harm to a healthy human, plant or animal. Since pathogenicity includes both toxigenicity and allergenicity, the GMM should therefore be:</p>
                               <p>3.1.1.   Non-toxigenic</p>
                               <p>The GMM should not produce increased toxigenicity as a result of the genetic modification nor be noted for its toxigenic properties.</p>
                               <p>3.1.2.   Non-allergenic</p>
                               <p>The GMM should not produce increased allergenicity as a result of the genetic modification nor be a noted allergen, having, for example, allergenicity comparable in particular with that of the micro-organisms identified in Directive 2000/54/EC.</p>
                               <p>3.2.   No harmful adventitious agents</p>
                               <p>The GMM should not harbour known harmful adventitious agents such as other micro-organisms, active or latent, existing alongside or inside the GMM, that could cause harm to human health and the environment.</p>
                               <p>3.3.   Transfer of genetic material</p>
                               <p>The modified genetic material must not give rise to harm if transferred; nor should it be self-transmissible or transferable at a frequency greater than other genes of the recipient or parental micro-organism.</p>
                               <p>3.4.   Safety for the environment in the event of a significant and unintended release</p>
                               <p>GMMs must not produce adverse effects on the environment, immediate or delayed, should any incident involving a significant and unintended release occur.</p>
                               <p>GMMs that do not meet the above criteria may not be included in Part C.</p>

In order to obtain the necessary information to implement this process the user may firstly take into account relevant Community legislation (in particular Directive 2000/54/EC). International or national classification schemes (e.g. World Health Organisation, National Institutes of Health) and their revisions due to new scientific knowledge and technical progress may also be considered.</p>
                                           <p>These schemes concern natural micro-organisms and as such are usually based on the ability of micro-organisms to cause disease to humans, animals or plants and on the severity and transmissibility of the disease likely to be caused. Directive 2000/54/EC classifies micro-organisms, as biological agents, into four classes of risk on the basis of potential effects on a healthy human adult. These classes of risk can be used as guidance for the purposes of categorisation of the contained use activities in the four classes of risk referred to in Article 4(3). The user may also take into consideration classification schemes referring to plant and animal pathogens (which are usually established on a national basis). The abovementioned classification schemes give only a provisional indication of the risk class of the activity and the corresponding set of containment and control measures.</p>

                                         <p>(1) La direttiva 90/219/CEE del Consiglio, del 23 aprile 1990, sull&#039;impiego confinato di microrganismi geneticamente modificati<a id="ntc3-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0003"> (<span >3</span>)</a>, ha subito diverse e sostanziali modificazioni<a id="ntc4-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0004"> (<span >4</span>)</a>. In occasione di nuove modificazioni, è opportuno, per ragioni di chiarezza, procedere alla rifusione delle disposizioni in questione.</p>
                           
                                      
                                         <p> (2) Ai sensi del trattato, l&#039;azione della Comunità in materia ambientale deve fondarsi sul principio dell&#039;azione preventiva e deve avere come obiettivo, fra l’altro, di salvaguardare, proteggere e migliorare l&#039;ambiente nonché tutelare la salute umana.</p>
                                   
                                         <p>(3) Le misure riguardanti la valutazione e l&#039;uso ottimale della biotecnologia nei confronti dell&#039;ambiente costituiscono un&#039;area prioritaria su cui dovrebbe concentrarsi l&#039;azione della Comunità.</p>
                                      
                                         <p>(4) Lo sviluppo della biotecnologia è tale da contribuire all&#039;espansione economica degli Stati membri. Ciò implica che i microrganismi geneticamente modificati (MGM) saranno impiegati in operazioni di vari tipi ed entità.</p>
                           
                                      
                                         <p>(5) L&#039;impiego confinato di MGM dovrebbe essere effettuato in modo da limitare le loro possibili conseguenze negative sulla salute umana e sull&#039;ambiente, con la dovuta attenzione alla prevenzione degli incidenti e al controllo dei rifiuti.</p>
                                   
                                         <p>(6) I MGM smaltiti senza che siano adeguatamente previste misure specifiche di contenimento al fine di limitare il contatto con la popolazione e con l&#039;ambiente non rientrano nel campo di applicazione della presente direttiva. Possono applicarsi altre normative comunitarie, come la direttiva 2001/18/CE del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio, del 12 marzo 2001, sull’emissione deliberata nell’ambiente di organismi geneticamente modificati<a id="ntc5-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0005"> (<span >5</span>)</a>.</p>
                          
                                         <p>(7) I microrganismi rilasciati nell&#039;ambiente in uno Stato membro nel corso del loro impiego confinato possono riprodursi e diffondersi oltre le frontiere nazionali, interessando così altri Stati membri.</p>
                                     
                                    
                                         <p>(8) Per permettere uno sviluppo sicuro delle biotecnologie in tutta la Comunità è necessario stabilire misure comuni per la valutazione e la riduzione dei rischi potenziali derivanti da ogni operazione che comporti l&#039;impiego confinato di MGM e stabilire modalità appropriate per l&#039;impiego degli stessi.</p>
                                     
                                     
                                     
                                         <p>(9) La natura precisa e l&#039;entità dei rischi associati all&#039;impiego confinato di MGM non sono ancora completamente note e i rischi connessi devono essere valutati caso per caso. Al fine di valutare i rischi per la salute dell&#039;uomo e dell&#039;ambiente, è necessario stabilire criteri di valutazione del rischio.</p>
                               
                                         <p>(10) Gli impieghi confinati di MGM dovrebbero essere classificati in base ai rischi che comportano per la salute umana e l&#039;ambiente. Tale classificazione dovrebbe essere coerente con la prassi internazionale e basarsi su una valutazione dei rischi.</p>
                                   
                                         <p>(11) Per garantire un livello di protezione elevato, le misure di contenimento e le altre misure di protezione applicate a un impiego confinato devono corrispondere alla classificazione di tale impiego confinato. In caso di incertezza, si dovrebbero applicare le idonee misure di contenimento e le altre misure di protezione relative alla classificazione più elevata fino a quando vi siano dati adeguati che giustifichino una riduzione delle misure.</p>
                                     
                                         <p>(12) Per tutte le attività che prevedono l&#039;impiego di MGM si dovrebbero applicare i principi di buona prassi microbiologica nonché di buona sicurezza e igiene del lavoro, secondo la pertinente normativa comunitaria.</p>
                                 
                                         <p>(13) Si dovrebbero applicare misure di confinamento nei vari stadi dell&#039;operazione per controllare le emissioni e lo smaltimento del materiale derivante dagli impieghi confinati di MGM, e prevenire eventuali incidenti.</p>
                                  
                                         <p>(14) Chiunque, prima di intraprendere per la prima volta l&#039;impiego confinato di un MGM in un impianto specifico, dovrebbe presentare una notifica all&#039;autorità competente affinché questa possa sincerarsi che l&#039;impianto proposto è atto a svolgere l&#039;attività in modo da non rappresentare un pericolo per la salute umana e l&#039;ambiente.</p>
                          
                                     
                                         <p>(15) È altresì necessario stabilire procedure appropriate per la notifica, caso per caso, di operazioni specifiche comportanti l&#039;impiego confinato di MGM, tenendo conto del grado di rischio connesso.</p>
                                 
                                         <p>(16) Nel caso di operazioni ad alto rischio è opportuno il consenso dell&#039;autorità competente.</p>
                                      
                           
                                         <p>(17) Le misure di contenimento e le altre misure di protezione applicate agli impieghi confinati dovrebbero essere rivedute periodicamente.</p>
                                                 
                                         <p>(18) Si potrebbe ritenere opportuno consultare il pubblico sull&#039;impiego confinato di MGM.</p>
                                 
                                         <p>(19) Le persone che partecipano ad attività che prevedono impieghi confinati dovrebbero essere consultate in base a quanto prevede la normativa comunitaria pertinente, in particolare la direttiva 2000/54/CE del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio, del 18 settembre 2000, relativa alla protezione dei lavoratori contro i rischi derivanti da un&#039;esposizione ad agenti biologici durante il lavoro (settima direttiva particolare ai sensi dell&#039;articolo 16, paragrafo 1 della direttiva 89/391/CEE)<a id="ntc6-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0006"> (<span >6</span>)</a>.</p>
                                     
                                         <p>(20) È opportuno prendere i provvedimenti appropriati per informare qualsiasi persona che potrebbe essere coinvolta in un incidente su tutte le questioni riguardanti la sicurezza.</p>
                          
                                         <p>(21) Dovrebbero essere stabiliti piani d&#039;emergenza per far fronte in modo efficace agli incidenti.</p>
                                   
                          
                                         <p>(22) Se avviene un incidente, l&#039;utilizzatore dovrebbe informarne immediatamente l&#039;autorità competente comunicando le informazioni necessarie per valutarne la portata e per prendere i provvedimenti appropriati.</p>
                                 
                                         <p>(23) È opportuno che la Commissione, in consultazione con gli Stati membri, stabilisca una procedura per lo scambio d&#039;informazioni sugli incidenti e che la Commissione tenga un registro degli stessi.</p>
                                    
                          
                                         <p>(24) L&#039;impiego confinato dei MGM nella Comunità dovrebbe essere tenuto sotto controllo e a tal fine gli Stati membri dovrebbero fornire alla Commissione determinate informazioni.</p>
                                    
                                         <p>(25) Al fine di essere considerati sicuri per la salute umana e per l&#039;ambiente i MGM dovrebbero corrispondere all’elenco di criteri di cui all’allegato II, parte B. Per tener conto della rapidità con la quale la biotecnologia sta avanzando, della natura dei criteri da elaborare e della portata limitata di detto elenco, è appropriato che il Consiglio definisca e riveda tali criteri, che devono, se del caso, essere completati da note esplicative dettagliate al fine di facilitare la loro applicazione</p>
                             
                                         <p  >(26) Le misure necessarie per l’applicazione della presente direttiva sono adottate in conformità alla decisione 1999/468/CE del Consiglio, del 28 giugno 1999, recante modalità per l&#039;esercizio delle competenze di esecuzione conferite alla Commissione<a id="ntc7-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2009125IT.01007501-E0007"> (<span >7</span>)</a>.</p>
                                   
                                         <p>(27)In particolare, la Commissione dovrebbe avere il potere di adottare le misure necessarie per l&#039;adeguamento tecnico degli allegati II, III, IV e V e per l&#039;adeguamento dell&#039;allegato II, parte C. Tali misure di portata generale e intese a modificare elementi non essenziali della presente direttiva, devono essere adottate secondo la procedura di regolamentazione con controllo di cui all&#039;articolo 5 <span  >bis</span> della decisione 1999/468/CE.</p>
                                        <p>(28) I nuovi elementi introdotti nella presente direttiva riguardano esclusivamente le procedure di comitato. Non sono pertanto necessari, al riguardo, provvedimenti di recepimento da parte degli Stati membri.</p>
                                     
                                         <p>(29)La presente direttiva dovrebbe far salvi gli obblighi degli Stati membri relativi ai termini di recepimento nel diritto nazionale delle direttive indicati nell&#039;allegato VI, parte B,</p>

                             <p  >HANNO ADOTTATO LA PRESENTE DIRETTIVA:</p>
                             <p align="center"><i>Articolo 1</p></i>
                             <p>La presente direttiva stabilisce misure comuni per l&#039;impiego confinato dei microrganismi geneticamente modificati per tutelare la salute dell&#039;uomo e l&#039;ambiente.</p>
                             <p align="center"><i>Articolo 2</p></i>
                             <p>Ai fini della presente direttiva valgono le seguenti definizioni:</p>
                             <p>a)   «microrganismi»: ogni entità microbiologica, cellulare e non cellulare, capace di replicarsi o di trasferire materiale genetico, compresi virus, viroidi e cellule animali e vegetali in coltura;</p>
                             <p>b)   «microrganismo geneticamente modificato» (MGM): un microrganismo il cui materiale genetico è stato modificato in un modo non naturale mediante moltiplicazione o ricombinazione naturale: nell&#039;ambito di questa definizione:</p>
                             <p>c)   «impiego confinato»: ogni attività nella quale i microrganismi sono modificati geneticamente o nella quale tali MGM sono messi in coltura, conservati, trasportati, distrutti, smaltiti o altrimenti utilizzati, e per la quale vengono usate misure specifiche di contenimento al fine di limitare il contatto degli stessi con la popolazione e con l&#039;ambiente e per garantire a questi ultimi un livello elevato di sicurezza;</p>
                             <p>d)   «incidente»: ogni evento imprevisto che comporti una diffusione significativa e non intenzionale di MGM nel corso del loro impiego confinato e che possa presentare un pericolo, immediato o differito, per la salute dell&#039;uomo o per l&#039;ambiente;</p>
                             <p>e)   «utilizzatore»: qualsiasi persona fisica o giuridica responsabile dell&#039;impiego confinato di MGM;</p>
                             <p>f)   «notifica»: la presentazione delle informazioni richieste alle autorità competenti di uno Stato membro.</p>
                             <p align="center"><i>Articolo 3</p></i>
                             <p  >1.   Fatto salvo l&#039;articolo 4, paragrafo 1, la presente direttiva non si applica:</p>
                             
                                <ul>
                                   
                                    
                                         <p>a) qualora la modificazione genetica sia ottenuta con l&#039;impiego delle tecniche o delle metodologie elencate nell&#039;allegato II, parte A; o</p>
                                    
                                         <p>b) per impieghi confinati concernenti soltanto tipi di MGM che soddisfino i criteri elencati nell&#039;allegato II, parte B, che ne stabiliscono la sicurezza per la salute umana e per l&#039;ambiente. Tali tipi di MGM devono essere elencati nell&#039;allegato II, parte C.</p>
                                     </ul>
                             <p  >2.   L&#039;articolo 4, paragrafi 3 e 6 e gli articoli da 5 a 11 non si applicano al trasporto di MGM su strada, per ferrovia, per via navigabile interna, per mare o per via aerea.</p>
                             <p  >3.   La presente direttiva non si applica alla conservazione, alla coltura, al trasporto, alla distruzione, allo smaltimento o all&#039;impiego di MGM immessi sul mercato in base alla direttiva 2001/18/CE, o ad altra normativa comunitaria, che comporti una specifica valutazione dei rischi ambientali equivalente a quella stabilita da tale direttiva, a condizione che l&#039;impiego confinato soddisfi gli eventuali requisiti del consenso per l&#039;immissione sul mercato.</p>
                             <p align="center"><i>Articolo 4</p></i>
                             <p  >1.   Gli Stati membri provvedono affinché siano prese le misure adeguate per evitare gli effetti nocivi che l&#039;impiego confinato di MGM potrebbe esercitare sulla salute dell&#039;uomo e sull&#039;ambiente.</p>
                             <p  >2.   A tal fine, l&#039;utilizzatore procede a una valutazione degli impieghi confinati ai fini dei rischi per la salute umana e per l&#039;ambiente che tale uso confinato può presentare, utilizzando quale criterio minimo gli elementi di valutazione e la procedura di cui all&#039;allegato III, parti A e B.</p>
                             <p  >3.   La valutazione di cui al paragrafo 2 si ottiene dalla classificazione finale degli impieghi confinati in quattro classi mediante l&#039;applicazione della procedura di cui all&#039;allegato III, che determinerà l&#039;attribuzione dei livelli di contenimento a norma dell&#039;articolo 5:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                         <p>Classe 1:</p>
                              
                                         <p>operazioni che presentano rischi nulli o trascurabili, ovvero operazioni per le quali un livello 1 di contenimento è adeguato a proteggere la salute umana e l&#039;ambiente.</p>
                                     
                                         <p>Classe 2:</p>
                                      
                                         <p>operazioni a basso rischio, ovvero operazioni per le quali un livello 2 di contenimento è adeguato a proteggere la salute umana e l&#039;ambiente.</p>
                                     
                                         <p>Classe 3:</p>
                                         <p>operazioni che presentano un rischio moderato, ovvero operazioni per le quali un livello 3 di contenimento è adeguato a proteggere la salute umana e l&#039;ambiente.</p>
                                    
                                         <p  >Classe 4:</p>
                                      
                                         <p  >operazioni ad alto rischio, ovvero operazioni per le quali un livello 4 di contenimento è adeguato a proteggere la salute umana e l&#039;ambiente.</p>
                                      </ul>
                             <p  >4.   Qualora sussista un dubbio su quale classe sia appropriata per l&#039;impiego confinato proposto, si applicano le misure di protezione più rigorose, a meno che vi sia prova sufficiente, d&#039;intesa con l&#039;autorità competente, che giustifichi l&#039;applicazione di misure meno rigorose.</p>
                             <p  >5.   La valutazione di cui al paragrafo 2 tiene in particolare considerazione il problema dello smaltimento dei rifiuti e degli effluenti.

                                            <p>3. La prima fase della procedura di valutazione dovrebbe consistere nell&#039;individuare le proprietà nocive del ricettore e, se del caso, del microrganismo donatore, le eventuali caratteristiche di pericolosità associate al vettore o al materiale inserito, compresa ogni eventuale alterazione delle proprietà proprie del ricevente.</p>
                                         
                                            <p  >4. In generale, soltanto gli MGM che posseggono le seguenti caratteristiche dovrebbero essere considerati tali da poter rientrare nella classe 1 di cui all&#039;articolo 4, paragrafo 3:</p>
                                                  <ul>

                                            <p>5. L&#039;utilizzatore può prendere conoscenza delle informazioni necessarie ad attuare tale procedura tenendo conto in primo luogo della normativa comunitaria pertinente (in particolare la direttiva 2000/54/CE). Possono essere presi in considerazione anche schemi di classificazione nazionali o internazionali (per esempio, Organizzazione mondiale della sanità, Istituti nazionali di sanità) e le relative versioni aggiornate in conseguenza di nuove conoscenze scientifiche e del progresso tecnico.</p>
                                            <p>Questi schemi riguardano microrganismi naturali e in quanto tali si basano solitamente sulla capacità dei microrganismi di provocare malattie per gli esseri umani, gli animali o le piante e sulla gravità e trasmissibilità della malattia che essi sono in grado di provocare. La direttiva 2000/54/CE classifica i microrganismi, in quanto agenti biologici, in quattro gruppi di rischio nella base dei loro effetti potenziali su un individuo adulto sano. Tali gruppi di rischio possono essere usati come riferimenti ai fini della classificazione delle attività di impiego confinato nelle quattro classi di rischio di cui all&#039;articolo 4, paragrafo 3. L&#039;utilizzatore può anche prendere in considerazione gli schemi di classificazione che si riferiscono agli agenti patogeni per le piante e per gli animali (di solito stabiliti su base nazionale). I suddetti schemi di classificazione forniscono solo un&#039;indicazione provvisoria della classe di rischio dell&#039;attività e delle relative misure di contenimento e di controllo.</p>
                                      
                                            <p>6. La procedura di individuazione del rischio, eseguita a norma dei precedenti punti 3, 4 e 5 dovrebbe portare all&#039;individuazione del livello di rischio associato all&#039;MGM.</p>
                                         
                                            
                                            <p>7. La selezione di misure di contenimento e di altre misure di protezione dovrebbe quindi basarsi sul livello di rischio associato all&#039;MGM, tenendo presenti nel contempo:</p>
