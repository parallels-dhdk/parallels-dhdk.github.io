            <h3>1927</h3>
            <p>In the early 1900s, a group of young and rebellious Italian writers and artists emerged determined to celebrate industrialization, they believed that the “Machine Age” would result in an entirely new world order and even a renewed consciousness.
			Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the leader of this group, called the movement Futurism. Its members sought to capture the idea of modernity, the sensations and aesthetics of speed, movement, and industrial development
			For the realization of the futurist style I took inspiration from the <b>Bolted Book</b> (so called because of its signature binding using two industrial bolts) made by the futurist artist Depero in 1927.
			</p>
			<h4>Home Page</h4>
			<p>For the home page I did not really take inspiration from a historical Futurist magazine, I focused more on the characteristics that it is possible to find in the texts of authors who followed the current.
			The idea of words placed diagonally, with respect to the field of the page, that we can often find in Futurist posters comes from the trends of both Bauhaus and Suprematism.</p>
			<span>Layout-Home Page</span>
			<p>Like Depero I played with contrasting sizes and weights, column, white space, orientation. For this reason I decided to use different rotation angle for the introductions to the articles and changed the width and height of each one. I kept wide white spaces trying to emulate the Dynamism of its pages.
			Moreover, through the use of thick black lines around the articles and a black line on the border I wanted to emphasize the nullification of the harmony of the page.</p>
			 <span>Title</span>
			<p>In order to represent the idea of decomposition of the text, the typographical disproportion and the dynamism that characterizes the futurist movement,I decided to decompose the title into several lines (reducing the margins and increasing the font size), I adding also the underline effect and a vibrant color to give more contrast. I used a font that would reproduce those most used by Depero in his text.</p>
			<span>Font</span>
			<p>For the header and the links I took inspiration from the fonts used in futurist posters and in fact I chose the font called "futurism".
			Regarding the font of the articles, instead I decided to use a font with geometric lines and bold that could show the strong contrast with the white background of the page.</p>
			<span>Background</span>
			<p>For the background I decided to use a sheet of metal to represent the concept of industrialization that is outlined in those years and that is largely emphasised by the futurist current</p>
			<h4> Article</h4>
			<p>For the typographical characteristics of the articles, as I specified for the home page, I also referred to posters and works of a futuristic nature and not to a newspaper.</p>
			<span>Layout-article</span>
			<p>For the division into two columns of the layout of the articles I referred to the futurist magazine "Lacerba". The remaining choices made derive from the idea of combining the main features of the futurist style and consequently I imagined a newspaper page that could best represent them. 
			For the use of the color red,for the subtitles or underline, I took inspiration from Depero who used the colors to emphasize the texts.</p>
			<span> Title</span>
			<p>The decision to overturn the title comes from the idea of  emphasize the distortion of the harmony of the text and the freedom that characterized the typographic choices of the current.</p> 
			<span>Font</span>
			<p>I used for the titles, subtitles and text, all different fonts, including the most used by Depero such as (hasta grotesk, Bernhard Antique, Typo Grotesk Black, Normande Regular and Bit stream lowan Old). Fonts that are not part of the typographical package imposed by tradition.
			I decided to use for the text a font that gives the idea of bold (LibbyHeavy) and the use of italics for subtitles to take up the futurist conception that the variation of the fonts creates a composition that connects the reader  with the events of the text. I have also added at the end of each paragraph a brace because, as it possible see in many writings of the Futurist style, the punctuation was erased and replaced by mathematical or musical symbols.
			Also for the "span" I used a different style and I tried to refer to the use of lines and shapes within the test by adding a top and bottom thick border.</p>
			<span> Image</span>  
			<p>the images are in black and white as they were included in the newspaper of the time.
			With the images I tried to make the Destruction of Syntax and the freedom of the layout by rotating them and giving the impression that they fluctuated within the page. 
			In contrast to this freedom I decided to insert a thick black border around the images to emphasize their role within the text.</p>
			<span>Figcaption</span>  
			<p>To emphasize the dynamism of the text and to express the idea of words that explode in the page and that have their own freedom I aligned vertically the words of the figcaption and used a completely different font for  style and weight  from  those used previously .</p>
			<span>Table</span>
			<p>For the creation of the tables, I let myself be influenced by the idea of text enclosed within geometric shapes, an idea used several times in Depero's book. I also tried to reproduce the idea of the inverted title that I had previously exploited within the articles and the idea of decomposed words using break-words.</p>	

			<h4 > About</h4>
			<p>The general idea of this page is to highlight the concept of disharmony of the page using dimensions and spaces of different sizes.</p>
			<span>Title</span>
			<p> For the title of the section "about" I decided to make the font an uppercase and extremely large size as Depero used to do in some pages of his book to capture the attention of the reader.
			Moreover, by placing it on the left of the page and maintaining the longer border bottom I tried to give the idea of movement, also present in futurist works.</p>
			<span>Cards </span>
			<p>For the structure of the cards, always taking into account the style used by Depero, I created a contrast using a basic geometric structure in contrast with the use of round images. As I done in the text of the articles I inserted  square brackets at the end of the paragraphs. 
			Furthermore in the cards I used different fonts with bold of different thickness to make the text more dynamic.</p>
			<h4>Documentation</h4>
			<span> Layout-documentation</span>
			<p>For the layout of the documentation section, always referring to the works of Depero, with the possibility to use the "id" I was able to arrange each div for a historical period at a different margin from the left edge, to give the idea of paragraphs free from a predefined scheme and independent. These choices take inspiration from the futurist idea of unhinging the page</p>
			<span> Title</span>
			<p>For the titles of the sections I chose to insert arrows to attract the attention of the reader as the futurists did using mathematical signs, numbers, brackets.</p>
			<span> Font</span>
			<p>For each section I chose a different font and with different weight, according to the futurist theory this was a way to represent the moods that the text should evoke, in my case, instead allows  to identify the parts that deal with different topics.I tried to use fonts that were more similar to those used in Futurist texts. In most cases the fonts used for the content were traditional, they were enriched by adding symbols and changing the font-size </p>

                  <h3>2040</h3>
                  
                  <p><i>“As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fasters reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. 
                  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down.
                  How did this happen?”</i> (Idiocracy, 2006)</p>

                  <p>The larger the human population grows, the average human I.Q. seems to drop. How can this happen even if we have all these technological advances? Even though we have much more social media and technology. How is this possible? 
                  Recent studies conducted on the I.Q. of the world population have revealed that the average I.Q. is decreasing very quickly 
                  (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/13/health/falling-iq-scores-study-intl/index.html">“IQ scores are falling and have been for decades, new study finds”</a>; <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2730791/Are-STUPID-Britons-people-IQ-decline.html">“Are we becoming more stupid? IQ scores are decreasing”</a>).</p>

                  <p>Considering these results, I’ve hypothesized a negative web environment in the future. If the I.Q. level is decreasing so rapidly, in 2040 there will be no one interested in information and in reading the news, so nobody will be interested in spreading it through the web.
                  Probably in 2040 there will be only a few nostalgic of web-news that will create websites with the only purpose of having fun with old technology, with a strong reference to the graphics of the 90s.</p>

                  <p>For the style of 2040, I took inspiration from Brutalism (<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/brutalism-brutalist-websites.html">awwwards.com</a>; <a href="https://codepen.io/brianhaferkamp/post/brutalism-isn-t-the-absence-of-modernity">codepen.io</a>; <a href="https://www.uxbrutalism.com/">uxbrutalism.com</a>; <a href="https://www.ilpost.it/2016/05/13/siti-brutti-brutalismo/">ilpost.it</a>; <a href="https://www.html.it/03/03/2017/brutalist-web-design-il-trend-che-non-trova-freni/">html.it</a>).</p>

                  <p>Usability? Legibility? Common sense? Forget everything you know about good practice of web design. In 2040 we will be in the Brutalist Era.
                  The nowadays web design is characterized by the prevailing minimalism, often chosen as an elegant and essential proposal to present a product or to make navigation easy. Brutalism is a more extreme current than minimalism, almost in contrast.
                  It was rapidly growing trend of 2017, made up of “rough” sites, reduced to the bone, where text games are predominant and where apparently extraneous graphic elements can coexist. A raw current inspired by the architectural brutality of the XX century, at least at the level of concept, designed to create an unexpected aesthetic alternative to the mainstream web design standards. All focusing on both the surprise effect and unpleasant but at the same time fascinating elements. 
                  Brutalist websites have elementary and chaotic graphics, dominated by text games, artistic and disruptive interaction of images and illustrations, where there is no universal concept of beauty.
                  Brutalism isn't an absence of modernity. It is the absence of a modern aesthetic. It merely shows what is normally hidden beneath the gleaming facade. It can be seen as a reaction to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity.
                  Brutalism is against rationalism, functionality and usability. It can be defined as freestyle ugly irreverent raw and superficially decorative.
                  Brutalist websites are not prehistorical things that can only use HTML. Rather, they embrace structural CSS and JavaScript.</p> 

                  <p>
                    Some elements of brutalism include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Non-system (web-safe) fonts</li>
                          <li>Images with filters, blurs, etc. in the weirdest and most uncomfortable of places</li>
                          <li>Giant cursor </li>
                          <li>Excessive use of hover effects</li>
                          <li>Micro interactions</li>
                          <li>Unusability</li>
                          <li>Users unfriendly practices</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                   <p>The first step is to throw elements on the screen, without worrying too much about how they work together. Who are you to define hierarchy anyway? Let each element fight for the spotlight.
                    The secret to great brutalist is contrast and irregularity. 
                   </p>

                  <p><span>Specific features</span>
                    <ol>
                      <li>HOMEPAGE: 
                        <ul>
                          <li>In the homepage, each element is designed to create, at first glance, a sense of surprise, discomfort and confusion in the user. The title in motion, the shape of a viewfinder of the cursor, links that change position every time you pass over it and the animated background take inspiration from video games of the 90s and from pixel art.</li>
                          <li>The fonts and colors chosen for the homepage are the result of a research on the worst chromatic and textual combinations, in order to visually disturb the user and create disgust. Some examples are: yellow text on green background, red text on violet background or purple text on orange background. All together it is like a game in which the user is called to actively participate in first person.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li>ARTICLES / ABOUT / DOCUMENTATION:
                        <ul>
                          <li>In the sections “Articles”, “About” and “Documentation”, there is a animated gradient background, with variations of shades from violet to blue, passing through fuchsia and red. The color of the font in the title and text is always yellow, which on each shade is particularly difficult to read. Noteworthy is the text font, Comic Sans: "If you love it, you don't know much about typography, if you hate it, you really don't know much about typography, either, and you should get another hobby." (Vincent Connare, creator of Comic Sans). The reference is to the disproportionate use of it that was made in the 90s and early 2000s.</li>
                          <li>The cursor is a giant hand that turns into an arrow when it passes over links, which increase their size.</li>
                          <li>The images are apparently positioned in such a way as to guarantee a fluent reading but passing over them with the cursor, they increase size and cover part of the text and the caption. Even the font color of the caption and background are not random: acid green on a pink background are bad color match and cause eye strain.</li>
                          <li>The spans of the articles are in continuous movement, with a flow from right to left, which it is possible to stop passing over with the cursor. For the EU Directive article the spans are fixed and glow.</li>
                          <li>The article tables alternatively include row with red and blue backgrounds, and blue and red fonts respectively. Passing over with the cursor, the cell color turns into green. </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                  </ol>
