            <h3>1927</h3>
            <p>In the early 1900s, a group of young and rebellious Italian writers and artists emerged determined to celebrate industrialization, they believed that the “Machine Age” would result in an entirely new world order and even a renewed consciousness.
			Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the leader of this group, called the movement Futurism. Its members sought to capture the idea of modernity, the sensations and aesthetics of speed, movement, and industrial development
			For the realization of the futurist style I took inspiration from the <b>Bolted Book</b> (so called because of its signature binding using two industrial bolts) made by the futurist artist Depero in 1927.
			</p>
			<h4>Home Page</h4>
			<p>For the home page I did not really take inspiration from a historical Futurist magazine, I focused more on the characteristics that it is possible to find in the texts of authors who followed the current.
			The idea of words placed diagonally, with respect to the field of the page, that we can often find in Futurist posters comes from the trends of both Bauhaus and Suprematism.</p>
			<span>Layout-Home Page</span>
			<p>Like Depero I played with contrasting sizes and weights, column, white space, orientation. For this reason I decided to use different rotation angle for the introductions to the articles and changed the width and height of each one. I kept wide white spaces trying to emulate the Dynamism of its pages.
			Moreover, through the use of thick black lines around the articles and a black line on the border I wanted to emphasize the nullification of the harmony of the page.</p>
			 <span>Title</span>
			<p>In order to represent the idea of decomposition of the text, the typographical disproportion and the dynamism that characterizes the futurist movement,I decided to decompose the title into several lines (reducing the margins and increasing the font size), I adding also the underline effect and a vibrant color to give more contrast. I used a font that would reproduce those most used by Depero in his text.</p>
			<span>Font</span>
			<p>For the header and the links I took inspiration from the fonts used in futurist posters and in fact I chose the font called "futurism".
			Regarding the font of the articles, instead I decided to use a font with geometric lines and bold that could show the strong contrast with the white background of the page.</p>
			<span>Background</span>
			<p>For the background I decided to use a sheet of metal to represent the concept of industrialization that is outlined in those years and that is largely emphasised by the futurist current</p>
			<h4> Article</h4>
			<p>For the typographical characteristics of the articles, as I specified for the home page, I also referred to posters and works of a futuristic nature and not to a newspaper.</p>
			<span>Layout-article</span>
			<p>For the division into two columns of the layout of the articles I referred to the futurist magazine "Lacerba". The remaining choices made derive from the idea of combining the main features of the futurist style and consequently I imagined a newspaper page that could best represent them. 
			For the use of the color red,for the subtitles or underline, I took inspiration from Depero who used the colors to emphasize the texts.</p>
			<span> Title</span>
			<p>The decision to overturn the title comes from the idea of  emphasize the distortion of the harmony of the text and the freedom that characterized the typographic choices of the current.</p> 
			<span>Font</span>
			<p>I used for the titles, subtitles and text, all different fonts, including the most used by Depero such as (hasta grotesk, Bernhard Antique, Typo Grotesk Black, Normande Regular and Bit stream lowan Old). Fonts that are not part of the typographical package imposed by tradition.
			I decided to use for the text a font that gives the idea of bold (LibbyHeavy) and the use of italics for subtitles to take up the futurist conception that the variation of the fonts creates a composition that connects the reader  with the events of the text. I have also added at the end of each paragraph a brace because, as it possible see in many writings of the Futurist style, the punctuation was erased and replaced by mathematical or musical symbols.
			Also for the "span" I used a different style and I tried to refer to the use of lines and shapes within the test by adding a top and bottom thick border.</p>
			<span> Image</span>  
			<p>the images are in black and white as they were included in the newspaper of the time.
			With the images I tried to make the Destruction of Syntax and the freedom of the layout by rotating them and giving the impression that they fluctuated within the page. 
			In contrast to this freedom I decided to insert a thick black border around the images to emphasize their role within the text.</p>
			<span>Figcaption</span>  
			<p>To emphasize the dynamism of the text and to express the idea of words that explode in the page and that have their own freedom I aligned vertically the words of the figcaption and used a completely different font for  style and weight  from  those used previously .</p>
			<span>Table</span>
			<p>For the creation of the tables, I let myself be influenced by the idea of text enclosed within geometric shapes, an idea used several times in Depero's book. I also tried to reproduce the idea of the inverted title that I had previously exploited within the articles and the idea of decomposed words using break-words.</p>	

			<h4 > About</h4>
			<p>The general idea of this page is to highlight the concept of disharmony of the page using dimensions and spaces of different sizes.</p>
			<span>Title</span>
			<p> For the title of the section "about" I decided to make the font an uppercase and extremely large size as Depero used to do in some pages of his book to capture the attention of the reader.
			Moreover, by placing it on the left of the page and maintaining the longer border bottom I tried to give the idea of movement, also present in futurist works.</p>
			<span>Cards </span>
			<p>For the structure of the cards, always taking into account the style used by Depero, I created a contrast using a basic geometric structure in contrast with the use of round images. As I done in the text of the articles I inserted  square brackets at the end of the paragraphs. 
			Furthermore in the cards I used different fonts with bold of different thickness to make the text more dynamic.</p>
			<h4>Documentation</h4>
			<span> Layout-documentation</span>
			<p>For the layout of the documentation section, always referring to the works of Depero, with the possibility to use the "id" I was able to arrange each div for a historical period at a different margin from the left edge, to give the idea of paragraphs free from a predefined scheme and independent. These choices take inspiration from the futurist idea of unhinging the page</p>
			<span> Title</span>
			<p>For the titles of the sections I chose to insert arrows to attract the attention of the reader as the futurists did using mathematical signs, numbers, brackets.</p>
			<span> Font</span>
			<p>For each section I chose a different font and with different weight, according to the futurist theory this was a way to represent the moods that the text should evoke, in my case, instead allows  to identify the parts that deal with different topics.I tried to use fonts that were more similar to those used in Futurist texts. In most cases the fonts used for the content were traditional, they were enriched by adding symbols and changing the font-size </p>

              <h3>1968</h3>
              <p>
                 <p>For the second half of the XX Centtury I was inspired by Avant Garde magazine. It was launched in 1968. It is defined as: exciting, vibrant, edgy, with just the right amount of playfulness, to move it out of the corporateness typical of the magazine of the time. The magazine ran for 3 years and The magazine's logo, inspired the typeface of the same name.
				It is remembered not only for its out-of-the-box content, often criticized by American society, but also for its innovations from the point of view of typography and design.
				Recently the magazine has been digitized and all the copies are online.</p>
				<h4>home page</h4>
				<span>Layout-home page</span>
				<p>It may be noted that I left the home page linear,. In addition to the name of the magazine, I included only the titles of the articles and the date/place of publication. I made this choice because I had the chance to observe that inside the magazine the part related to the index are left very basic and with linear fonts, and this choice, in my opinion, emphasizes even more the contrast that is created with the following pages: rich in color and particular fonts.</p>
	<!-------<img src="img/avant garde home page.png" alt="example of depero work"> </img>------>
			  <span> Title</span>
			  <p>For the title of the home page I tried to reproduce the typographic features of the magazine's logo, using the font created after the publication of the magazine. I decreased the "latter spacing", increased the weight of the letters and made it oblique to reproduce the same effect.</p>
			  <span>Font</span>
			  <p>As anticipated, for the home page I decided to keep a very clean line and to emphasize this choice I only included the titles of the articles (and links), according to what was done in Avant Garde magazine.  I used linear fonts that recall those present in the index section of the magazine such as "ITC Avant Garde Gothic " and for the header a pastel color that would resume the same soft tones.</p>  
			  <span>Background</span>
			  <p>For the background, I decided to use an image of Compact Cassette, to give the impression that the newspaper was leaning against these. The choice fell on the Compact Cassette because in the 60s there was their spread. I also tried to reproduce a color that could be similar to the pages of the magazine, aged over time.</p>
			<h4>Article</h4>
			  <span>Layout</span>
			  <p>For the 3-column subdivision of the layout of the articles I made reference to the magazine from which I took inspiration. The text of the articles, in fact, has a linear structure, which creates a strong contrast with the fonts used for the titles and the choice of images.</p>
			  <span>Title</span>
			  <p>Analyzing Avant Garde magazine it is possible notice how authors played with fonts for titles that differ from article to article. For this reason I had the opportunity to choose an unusual font compared to what normally people could see in a newspaper of the time. In particular, the font used was: "Windsor-Bold" one of many present in Avant Garde.</p>
			 <span>Font</span>
			  <p>Also regard to the subtitle font was not used a single font in particular, and for this reason I used a font that could create a contrast with the main title. 
			The choice of font for the body of the article instead was a classic font ("Book Antiqua"), enriched by the use of drop cap first letter of a bright color as was made in the magazine. This choices, in my opinion, come from the need give  a unique sign compared to other magazines and articles keeping some of the features of the newspaper tradition.</p>
			<span>Image</span>  
			<p>Inside the magazine there are not only the classic black and white photos but also drawings that  follow  different styles and photos to which have been applied particular filter.  For example in volume n.2 there are photos of Malyn Monroe, which remember the Pop Art style and it is from them I took inspiration, To show the change and the major stylistic and typographical freedoms that are beginning to take hold</p>

			<span>Figcaption</span>  
			<p>For the figcaption instead I kept a classic style as you can see in the magazine. and this choice shows once again the main feature of the magazine: the structure of a classic magazine with the addition of strong typographical and stylistic choices that could catch the attention.</p>
			<span>Table</span>
			<p> For the tables I tried to preserve a basic structure similar to what was done in the index of the magazine. I chose a pastel green color to give that slight touch of peculiarity. For the fonts I kept those that reflect the logo of the magazine. </p>	

			<h4> About</h4>
			<p>As for the articles I used a linear structure on three columns, enriching the page with particular fonts for the titles and a black background-color as the authors did for some pages in the magazine. 
			</p>
			<span>Cards </span>
			 <p>for the cards instead I have resumed the font of the home page to maintain the simplicity of the home page but in this case in strong contrast with the effect applied to the images.</p>
			 <h4>Documentation</h4>
			 <p>the structure of the documentation resume that used in the articles but in this case I chose a completely different font and also present in the magazine ("Viking Stencil"), the predominant color for the title and the first letters is a petroleum blue.</p>

                <h3>1980</h3>
                    <p>In 1980 in Italy there was a boom in glossy magazines: scoops, news reports and scandals were spread through the great titles printed on the front pages of magazines.
                    To best illustrate this period, I took as examples for my work the magazines "Novella 2000", a weekly magazine that in the 80s became the first Italian magazine specializing in entertainment and gossip, and "Epoca", a political news weekly, published by Mondadori from 1950 to 1997.</p>

                    <p><span>SPECIFIC FEATURES:</span>
                      <ol>
                        <li>HOMEPAGE
                          <ul>
                                <li>The layout of the first page presents large glossy images with an big title that captures attention through bright colors, large fonts and thick dividing lines between the articles. The title of the magazine is white on red background, white margin and takes inspiration from the titles of <a href="http://curiosando708090.altervista.org/novella-2000-rivista-dal-1967/">"Novella 2000"</a> and <a href="http://www.petitesondes.net/Epoca/1982-1655-p.pdf">"Epoca"</a>. For the title font ("Akilines") I took inspiration from "Mecanorma Graphic Book no. 9, catalog 1980 ”, a font manual that preserves all the styles most used in the 80s. </li>
                                <li>The article with the largest photograph, usually, was distinguished from the others in importance, consequently also the font of its title was greater and the brightest. The other articles were paginated at the edges of the page with smaller images. The purpose of a layout of this type was exactly to attract the reader and strike his curiosity.</li>
                                <li>The chosen background is of pure fantasy, however it recalls typical patterns of the 80s.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                              <ul>
                                  <li>The internal layout of the magazines of the 80s included the use of double-edged or patterned frames, each with a different margin and thickness.</li>
                                  <li>The font for the title of the articles was large and took up a lot of space on the page. We chose to use a heavy font because it was the style used mostly by "Novella 2000" and "Epoca".Subtitles generally were smaller and in italic. The metadata of the article are represented between two black lines above and below, stacked at the beginning of the article. We were inspired by the magazine “Il Sale. Weekly of satire,opinions, politics and second thoughts”(Year 1 – no. 3, 1982, June 9th). All the information relating to the title, subtitle and columns is taken from the manual A. Hohenegger, Graphic Design, 5th edition, Romana Libri Alfabeto, 1980, "La rivista".</li>
                                  <li>The page of a magazine is generally divided into two, three four and, in some cases, 5 columns (for large formats). Considering the length of the texts, we chose to use 2 columns. The large margin between the columns was chosen to respect the style philosophy of this historical period.</li>
                                  <li>The font for the text of the articles is Times New Roman as used by most of the magazines consulted, including "Epoca", "Oggi" (Year XXXVIII – N.2, 13-1-1982 and N.5, 3-2-1982), "Panorama" (Year XXV - N.1103, 1987, June 7th), "Il Sale" (Year 1 – N.3, 198, June 9th),"L'illustrazione italiana"(Year III - N.9, 1983, February-March). The first letter of the articles differs from the text by font and size. </li>
                                  <li>Spans are of invention but reflect the style of the historical period because they are enclosed between two black lines and the text is in italic as they used to highlight citations or important parts.
                                  2.2.5) in the magazines of the 80s there were different formats for photographs: they could be rectangular, round, oval or have particular shapes. They were inserted into the columns of the articles, and could occupy two or more columns, an entire page or even two pages. In the articles proposed in this work it is not possible to extend the images on multiple columns because it is impossible to predict and control the overlap of images.</li>
                                  <li>The style of the tables is taken from the computer magazine "Nuova Elettronica" (Year 21 - N. 129, March 1989) and have alternately white and blue rows with black header.</li>
                              </ul>

                  <h3>2040</h3>
                  
                  <p><i>“As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fasters reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. 
                  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down.
                  How did this happen?”</i> (Idiocracy, 2006)</p>

                  <p>The larger the human population grows, the average human I.Q. seems to drop. How can this happen even if we have all these technological advances? Even though we have much more social media and technology. How is this possible? 
                  Recent studies conducted on the I.Q. of the world population have revealed that the average I.Q. is decreasing very quickly 
                  (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/13/health/falling-iq-scores-study-intl/index.html">“IQ scores are falling and have been for decades, new study finds”</a>; <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2730791/Are-STUPID-Britons-people-IQ-decline.html">“Are we becoming more stupid? IQ scores are decreasing”</a>).</p>

                  <p>Considering these results, we’ve hypothesized a negative web environment in the future. If the I.Q. level is decreasing so rapidly, in 2040 there will be no one interested in information and in reading the news, so nobody will be interested in spreading it through the web.
                  Probably in 2040 there will be only a few nostalgic of web-news that will create websites with the only purpose of having fun with old technology, with a strong reference to the graphics of the 90s.</p>

                  <p>For the style of 2040, we took inspiration from Brutalism (<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/brutalism-brutalist-websites.html">awwwards.com</a>; <a href="https://codepen.io/brianhaferkamp/post/brutalism-isn-t-the-absence-of-modernity">codepen.io</a>; <a href="https://www.uxbrutalism.com/">uxbrutalism.com</a>; <a href="https://www.ilpost.it/2016/05/13/siti-brutti-brutalismo/">ilpost.it</a>; <a href="https://www.html.it/03/03/2017/brutalist-web-design-il-trend-che-non-trova-freni/">html.it</a>).</p>

                  <p>Usability? Legibility? Common sense? Forget everything you know about good practice of web design. In 2040 we will be in the Brutalist Era.
                  The nowadays web design is characterized by the prevailing minimalism, often chosen as an elegant and essential proposal to present a product or to make navigation easy. Brutalism is a more extreme current than minimalism, almost in contrast.
                  It was rapidly growing trend of 2017, made up of “rough” sites, reduced to the bone, where text games are predominant and where apparently extraneous graphic elements can coexist. A raw current inspired by the architectural brutality of the XX century, at least at the level of concept, designed to create an unexpected aesthetic alternative to the mainstream web design standards. All focusing on both the surprise effect and unpleasant but at the same time fascinating elements. 
                  Brutalist websites have elementary and chaotic graphics, dominated by text games, artistic and disruptive interaction of images and illustrations, where there is no universal concept of beauty.
                  Brutalism isn't an absence of modernity. It is the absence of a modern aesthetic. It merely shows what is normally hidden beneath the gleaming facade. It can be seen as a reaction to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity.
                  Brutalism is against rationalism, functionality and usability. It can be defined as freestyle ugly irreverent raw and superficially decorative.
                  Brutalist websites are not prehistorical things that can only use HTML. Rather, they embrace structural CSS and JavaScript.</p> 

                  <p>
                    Some elements of brutalism include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Non-system (web-safe) fonts</li>
                          <li>Images with filters, blurs, etc. in the weirdest and most uncomfortable of places</li>
                          <li>Giant cursor </li>
                          <li>Excessive use of hover effects</li>
                          <li>Micro interactions</li>
                          <li>Unusability</li>
                          <li>Users unfriendly practices</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                   <p>The first step is to throw elements on the screen, without worrying too much about how they work together. Who are you to define hierarchy anyway? Let each element fight for the spotlight.
                    The secret to great brutalist is contrast and irregularity. 
                   </p>

                          <li>The fonts and colors chosen for the homepage are the result of a research on the worst chromatic and textual combinations, in order to visually disturb the user and create disgust. Some examples are: yellow text on green background, red text on violet background or purple text on orange background. All together it is like a game in which the user is called to actively participate in first person.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li>ARTICLES / ABOUT / DOCUMENTATION:
                        <ul>
                          <li>In the sections “Articles”, “About” and “Documentation”, there is a animated gradient background, with variations of shades from violet to blue, passing through fuchsia and red. The color of the font in the title and text is always yellow, which on each shade is particularly difficult to read. Noteworthy is the text font, Comic Sans: "If you love it, you don't know much about typography, if you hate it, you really don't know much about typography, either, and you should get another hobby." (Vincent Connare, creator of Comic Sans). The reference is to the disproportionate use of it that was made in the 90s and early 2000s.</li>
                          <li>The cursor is a giant hand that turns into an arrow when it passes over links, which increase their size.</li>
                          <li>The images are apparently positioned in such a way as to guarantee a fluent reading but passing over them with the cursor, they increase size and cover part of the text and the caption. Even the font color of the caption and background are not random: acid green on a pink background are bad color match and cause eye strain.</li>
                          <li>The spans of the articles are in continuous movement, with a flow from right to left, which it is possible to stop passing over with the cursor. For the EU Directive article the spans are fixed and glow.</li>
                          <li>The article tables alternatively include row with red and blue backgrounds, and blue and red fonts respectively. Passing over with the cursor, the cell color turns into green. </li>
