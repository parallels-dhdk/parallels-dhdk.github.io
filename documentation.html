        <h3>1560</h3>
        <p>The first style of our project dates back to the second half of the XVI century. We have chosen to deal with the contents of the website as they were essays of a Cinquecentina, a specific kind of book printed since the beginning of the XVI century. The name itself – Cinquecentina - is an Italian term coming from &#34;cinquecentesco&#34;, an adjective that means &#34;from the Sixteenth Century&#34;. 
        This kind of book was printed in particular by Venetian typographers: it is estimated that in this period Venice has produced around a half of all the books printed in Italy. Indeed, the presence of capital and raw materials in the city, especially paper, allowed printers who established in Venice their own printing house - including the famous Aldo Manuzio - to carry out numerous publishing initiatives and a large diffusion of this type of books. Therefore, we have taken as a reference point for this style Cinquecentinas printed in the Serenissima during the decade 1560-1570.</p>

        <h4> The typesetting environment </h4>
        <p>As to recreate the effect of an ancient book, the text has been divided into sections, each of which ideally represents two pages of the book. The background has been created with GIMP-2.10 (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slyka85/assets/master/bookcover2.png;">book cover source; </a><a href="/http://hasshe.com/old-white-lined-paper-5b7aa50d2756dd6f6c7f5362/*">paper sheet source</a>).
        The layout type of the Cinquecentina was generally set in one justified column per page, placed symmetrically on the page. From the start, printers understood the importance of the relative relationships of various elements of layout. The mathematical proportions of various segments and margins were determined by geometry, and designers adhered to the aesthetic rules that governed the harmonious relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and solids to one another.
        The layout designs of the Cinquecentina still resembled the medieval compositions, using classical ornamentation, initials and bordering. Nevertheless, in comparison to medieval manuscripts, the Cinquecentina made a greater use of white space: they were no longer as dark and dense as the medieval illuminated manuscripts. As to follow this specification, we chose wide paddings, letterspacings and line heights. </p>

        <h4> The font choice </h4>
        <p>In Italy, together with the popularity of the Cinquecentina, the use of the lettera antiqua was widespread thanks to Aldo Manuzio, who since 1501 adopted for his books the italics, designed by the bolognese engraver and typographer Francesco Griffo. As a result, 16th-century printers began to integrate round and cursive styles into families of matching weights and x-height characters. In line with these characteristics, we have chosen to apply Hultog font to our texts, a simple antiqued font based on classic Venetian-style typefaces, both in its rounded and cursive versions. As another legacy of medieval manuscripts, drop caps where maintained as decorations of the first paragraph of the text. Differently from medieval times, drop caps generally were not painted and colored, but were the result of an engraved procedure. Despite this, they kept being very rich in decorations, that were frequently floral decorations. For the drop caps font we have chosen Goudy Initialen, floriated initials designed by Frederic W. Goudy, since they resemble some of the ones engraved by Giorgio Vasari in his work <i> Vasari - Le vite de’ più eccellente pittori, scultori, et architettori </i> (1568).

        <h4> Home page - Articles - About - Documentation </h4>
        <p>In the Cinquecentina the body of the text is justified, while titles, subtitles and in general information that the printer wants to emphasize are presented with a centered alignment. The title page, always located on the right page, becomes the most important part of the book and contains the significant elements of the work: the title, the author, the date and the publishing house, often accompanied by an engraved image. The title page settings have been replicated both on the project homepage and on individual articles. Another novelty brought by the sixteenth century was the widest use of illustrations (initially xylographic and then more and more calcographic) which became a significant presence among the pages, occupying the whole size of the page. Therefore, it was decided to give to the image a 100% width, along with a sepia effect to resemble the color of the aged paper. Furthermore, the style has been enriched with original engraved images: the decorations of the homepage, of the documentation page and of the eu-directive, and the frames of the photographs in the about page are works of the famous engraver and painter Giorgio Vasari, taken directly from the book: <i> Vasari - Le vite de’ più eccellente pittori, scultori, et architettori </i> (1568). 
        For the layout of the tables the reference point was <i>&#34;Diaologo di M. Lodovico Dolce, nel quale si ragiona del modo di accrescere e conservar la memoria&#34;</i>. Venezia, Giovanni Battista e Melchiorre Sessa, 1562. Venice, Giovanni Battista and melchiorre sessa, 1562.</p>

        <h4> Eu Directive </h4>  
        <p>As regards the EU directive, slightly different choices have been made as to facilitate the parallel and continuous consultation of the text in English and Italian and because of the nature of the document itself. Indeed, while maintaining the same choices with regards to typefaces and tables, the text is displayed as if it were a parchment scroll. In fact, if for most types of text the documents were bound in codex (books), the use of the scroll during the 16th century remained for several legal documents. This is why the English judicial official, the Keeper or Maintainer of the documents and notes of the Chancellery of England, was known as the &#34;Master of the Rolls&#34;.</p>

          <h3>1860</h3>
           <p>This style has been mainly inspired by the newspapers printed the United Kingdom during the second half of the XIX century. A series of developments that happened between 1850 and 1890 transformed the small closed newspaper world into big business. After the reduction of the stamp tax in 1836 from four pence to one penny, the circulation of English newspapers rose from 39,000,000 to 122,000,000 by 1854; a trend further exacerbated by technological improvements in transportation and communication and by the growth of literacy. By 1861 all taxes had ended, making cheap publications reaching a large market feasible. For the first time it was financially attractive to plan for much larger circulations and therefore to invest in the new technologies which had been impractical before. The Daily Telegraph appeared on 29 June 1855 and soon sold for 1 d. Sixteen new major provincials papers were founded, and older titles enlarge their scope. The Manchester Guardian, started out as a weekly in 1821, became a daily of 1855, as did the Liverpool Postand the Scotsman. The Times, edited by John Thadeus Delane stood preeminent. Therefore, from 1860 until 1910 was the &apos;golden age&apos; of newspaper publication, with technical advances in printing and communication combined with a professionalization of journalism and the prominence of new owners.</p>            

        <h4>The font choice </h4>
        <p> As regards the title, we chose the Engravers Old English font, on the bases of the title of a wide range of  19th-century newspaper masterheads - both from UK and other countries - including &#34;The Daily Telegraph&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;The New York Times&#34;, &#34;The Dublin Evening Mail&#34;, &#34;Western Mail&#34;, &#34;The Belfast News-Letter&#34;, &#34;The Alexandria Gazette&#34;. To relaunch the art of printing in the eighteenth century and to propose his typeface as a model for the new industrial activity in the nineteenth century remain the works of Giambattista Bodoni, who since 1768 is active in Parma, at the royal printing. From the <i>Saggio tipografico</i> of 1971, still under the influence of Pierre-Simon Fourier, up to the famous <i>Manuale tipografico</i> of 1818, Bodoni created a typographic art remained unsurpassed. That’s why we choose Bodoni as font for our paragraphs. After Bodoni, the 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called Egyptienne fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon&apos;s invasion in Egypt. In fact slab-serif fonts, like Clarendon from 1845, were other fonts used in newspaper, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Consequently, in our website the Claredon font is used along with Bodoni, for headers like h3 and h4.</p>

        <h4>Home Page – Articles – Documentation – Eu Directive </h4>
        <p>The layout of the home page has been inspired by some of the mayor newspaper first pages. Right under the title, placed on the top of the page, there was a line of text closed between top and bottom borders, indicating the date, the place of printing, the number of the edition and the price. We provided our first edition of Paralles with the same information, displaying it in the very same way: the announcement of the first edition on the right, the date and place centered, and the number of the edion on the right (replacing what originally was the price of the journal). Despite what one might think, for most of the nineteenth century the biggest daily newspapers carried nothing but densely-packed adverts on their front page, divided by threads to give a sense of order. In our case we decided to use titles and parts of the articles text to obtain the same effect. As in the first page, the text of the articles was justified and occupied a multi-column cage, with margins and line heights reduced at the minimum. 
        As page’s background we have recreated the effect of aged paper thanks the tool Noise Texture CSS Generator provided by the website CSSmatic https://www.cssmatic.com/noise-texture. To mimic the cut of the rotary press we added very tiny top and a bottom dotted borders. Furthermore, we added an overall background with a wood texture, imagining the newspaper fresh of print positioned on the table of the typography.</p>

            <h3>1927</h3>
            <p>In the early 1900s, a group of young and rebellious Italian writers and artists emerged determined to celebrate industrialization, they believed that the &#34;Machine Age&#34; would result in an entirely new world order and even a renewed consciousness.
            Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the leader of this group, called the movement Futurism. Its members sought to capture the idea of modernity, the sensations and aesthetics of speed, movement, and industrial development.
            For the realization of the futurist style we took inspiration mainly from the <b>Bolted Book</b> (so called because of its signature binding using two industrial bolts) made by the futurist artist Depero in 1927.</p>

            <h4>Home Page</h4>
            <p>For the home page we did not really take inspiration from a historical Futurist magazine, but more on the characteristics that it is possible to find in the texts of authors who followed the current.
            The idea of words placed diagonally, with respect to the field of the page, that we can often find in Futurist posters, comes from the trends of both Bauhaus and Suprematism.</p>
			    <p>Layout-Home Page: like Depero we played with contrasting sizes and weights, column, white space, orientation. For this reason we decided to use different rotation angle for the introductions to the articles and changed the width and height of each one. it is possibile notice wide white spaces trying to emulate the Dynamism of its pages. Moreover,thick black lines around the articles and a black line on the border  emphasize the nullification of the harmony of the page.</p>
			<p>Title: in order to represent the idea of decomposition of the text, the typographical disproportion and the dynamism that characterizes the futurist movement, the title has been decompose into several lines (reducing the margins and increasing the font size), adding also the underline effect and a vibrant color to give more contrast. The font used would reproduce those most used by Depero in his text.</p>
			<p>Font:the font of the header and the links are inspired by the fonts used in futurist posters and in fact one of this is called &#34;futurism&#34;.
			Regarding the font of the articles, has geometric lines and bold that could show the strong contrast with the white background of the page.</p>
			
			<p>Background: the background is a sheet of metal that represent the concept of industrialization that is outlined in those years and that is largely emphasised by the futurist current</p>
			<h4> Article</h4>
			<p>For the typographical characteristics of the articles, as we specified for the home page, we also referred to posters and works of a futuristic nature and not to a newspaper.</p>
			<p>Layout-article: the division into two columns of the layout of the articles Derive from the futurist magazine &#34;Lacerba&#34;. The remaining choices made, derive from the idea of combining the main features of the futurist style and consequently we imagined a newspaper page that could best represent them. 
			For the use of the color red,for the subtitles or underline, the inspiration come from Depero who used the colors to emphasize the texts.</p>

			<p>Title: the decision to overturn the title derived from the idea of  emphasize the distortion of the harmony of the text and the freedom that characterized the typographic choices of the current.</p> 
   
			<p>Font: for the titles, subtitles and text, it is possible notice the use of different fonts, including the most used by Depero such as (hasta grotesk, Bernhard Antique, Typo Grotesk Black, Normande Regular and Bit stream lowan Old). Fonts that are not part of the typographical package imposed by tradition.
			For the text was used a font that gives the idea of bold (LibbyHeavy) and the use of italics for subtitles to take up the futurist conception that the variation of the fonts creates a composition that connects the reader  with the events of the text. At the end of each paragraph there is a braces because, as it possible see in many writings of the Futurist style, the punctuation was erased and replaced by mathematical or musical symbols.
			Also for the &#34;span&#34; we choose a different style and we tried to refer to the use of lines and shapes within the test by adding a top and bottom thick border.</p>
       </section>
      <section>
		
			<p>Image: the images are in black and white as they were included in the newspaper of the time.
			With the images we tried to make the Destruction of Syntax and the freedom of the layout by rotating them and giving the impression that they fluctuated within the page. 
			In contrast to this freedom has been inserted thick black border around the images to emphasize their role within the text.</p>
	 
			<p>Figcaption: to emphasize the dynamism of the text and to express the idea of words that explode in the page and that have their own freedom the word of figcaption was aligned vertically and was used a completely different font for  style and weight  from  those used previously .</p>
	
			<p>Table: for the creation of the tables, we let influenced by the idea of text enclosed within geometric shapes, a concept used several times in Depero&apos;s book. Also fo the th of the table was used the idea of the inverted title  and  of the decomposition of words using break-words.</p>	

			<h4 > About</h4>
			<p>The general idea of this page is to highlight the concept of disharmony of the page using dimensions and spaces of different sizes.</p>
		
			<p>Title: for the title of the section &#34;About&#34;  The font is in an uppercase and extremely large size as Depero used to do in some pages of his book to capture the attention of the reader.
			Moreover, by placing it on the left of the page and maintaining the longer border bottom we tried to give the idea of movement, also present in futurist works.</p>
		
			<p>Cards: the structure of the cards, always taking into account the style used by Depero, uderline the concept of contrast using a basic geometric structure in opposition with the use of round images. As for the text of the articles are present square brackets at the end of the paragraphs. 
			Furthermore in the cards are used different fonts with bold of different thickness to make the text more dynamic.</p>
			<h4>Documentation</h4>
		
			<p>Layout-documentation: for the layout of the documentation section, always referring to the works of Depero, with the possibility to use the &#34;id&#34; it was possible to arrange each &#34;div&#34; for a historical period at a different margin from the left edge, to give the idea of paragraphs free from a predefined scheme and independent. These choices take inspiration from the futurist idea of unhinging the page</p>
		
			<p>Title: for the titles of the sections we chose to insert arrows to attract the attention of the reader as the futurists did using mathematical signs, numbers, brackets.</p>
		
			<p>Font: for each section it is possibile observ different font and with different weight, according to the futurist theory this was a way to represent the moods that the text should evoke, in my case, allows  to identify the parts that deal with different topics.The font used try to be  more similar to those used in Futurist texts.</p>

              <h3>1968</h3>
              <p>
                 <p>For the second half of the XX Centtury our ispiration was the Avant Garde magazine. It was launched in 1968. It is defined as: exciting, vibrant, edgy, with just the right amount of playfulness, to move it out of the corporateness typical of the magazine of the time. The magazine ran for 3 years and The magazine&apos;s logo, inspired the typeface of the same name.
				It is remembered not only for its out-of-the-box content, often criticized by American society, but also for its innovations from the point of view of typography and design.
				Recently the magazine has been digitized and all the copies are online.</p>
				<h4>Home page</h4>
			
				<p>Layout-home page: it may be noted that the home page is linear. In addition to the name of the magazine,itis present only the titles of the articles and the date/place of publication. we made this choice because  observing the magazine, the part related to the index are left very basic and with linear fonts, and this choice, in my opinion, emphasizes even more the contrast that is created with the following pages: rich in color and particular fonts.</p>
			 
			  <p>Title: for the title of the home page we tried to reproduce the typographic features of the magazine&apos;s logo, using the font created after the publication of the magazine. decreasing the &#34;latter spacing&#34;, increasing the weight of the letters and made it oblique to reproduce the same effect.</p>
			  
			  <p>Font: as anticipated, for the home page we decided to keep a very clean line and to emphasize this choice it was only included the titles of the articles (and links), according to what was done in Avant Garde magazine.the fonts has been used are linear and recall those present in the index section of the magazine such as &#34;ITC Avant Garde Gothic&#34; and for the header it has been applied a pastel color that would resume the same soft tones.</p>  

			  <p>Background: for the background, the choice has been made on an image of Compact Cassette, to give the impression that the newspaper was leaning against these. has been used Compact Cassette because in the 60s there was their spread. For the color of the page we also tried to reproduce a color that could be similar to the pages of the magazine, aged over time.</p>
			<h4>Article</h4>
			  <p>Layout: for the 3-column subdivision of the layout of the articles the reference was the magazine. The text of the articles, in fact, has a linear structure, which creates a strong contrast with the fonts used for the titles and the choice of images.</p>
			 
			  <p>Title: analyzing Avant Garde magazine it is possible notice how authors played with fonts for titles that differ from article to article. For this reason we had the opportunity to choose an unusual font compared to what normally people could see in a newspaper of the time. In particular, the font used was: &#34;Windsor-Bold&#34; one of many present in Avant Garde.</p>
		
			  <p>Font: also regard to the subtitle font was not used a single font in particular, and for this reason  a font that could create a contrast with the main title has been used. 
			The choice of font for the body of the article instead was a classic font (&#34;Book Antiqua&#34;), enriched by the use of drop cap first letter of a bright color as was made in the magazine. This choices, in my opinion, come from the need give  a unique sign compared to other magazines and articles keeping some of the features of the newspaper tradition.</p>
		
			<p>Image: inside the magazine there are not only the classic black and white photos but also drawings that  follow  different styles and photos to which have been applied particular filter.  For example in volume n.2 there are photos of Malyn Monroe, which remember the Pop Art style and it is from them we took inspiration, To show the change and the major stylistic and typographical freedoms that are beginning to take hold</p>

			<p>Figcaption: the figcaption are based on a classic style as in the magazine. This choice shows once again the main feature of the magazine: the structure of a classic magazine with the addition of strong typographical and stylistic choices that could catch the attention.</p>
			
			<p>Table: for the tables we tried to preserve a basic structure similar to what was done in the index of the magazine. the main color is a pastel green to give that slight touch of peculiarity. For the fonts has been maintained those that reflect the logo of the magazine. </p>	

			<h4> About</h4>
			<p>As for the articles the structure is linear and on three columns, enriching the page with particular fonts for the titles and a black background-color as the authors did for some pages in the magazine. 
			</p>
			 <p>Cards: for the cards instead we resumed the font of the home page to maintain the simplicity of the home page but in this case in strong contrast with the effect applied to the images.</p>
			 <h4>Documentation</h4>
			 <p>the structure of the documentation resume that used in the articles but in this case we chose a completely different font for the title but  present in the magazine (&#34;Viking Stencil&#34;), the predominant color for the title and the first letters is a petroleum blue.</p>

                <h3>1980</h3>
                    <p>In 1980 in Italy there was a boom in glossy magazines: scoops, news reports and scandals were spread through the great titles printed on the front pages of magazines.
                    To best illustrate this period, I took as examples for my work the magazines &#34;Novella 2000&#34;, a weekly magazine that in the 80s became the first Italian magazine specializing in entertainment and gossip, and &#34;Epoca&#34;, a political news weekly, published by Mondadori from 1950 to 1997.</p>

                  
                        <h4>Homepage</h4>
                          <p>The layout of the first page presents large glossy images with an big title that captures attention through bright colors, large fonts and thick dividing lines between the articles. The title of the magazine is white on red background, white margin and takes inspiration from the titles of <a href="http://curiosando708090.altervista.org/novella-2000-rivista-dal-1967/">&#34;Novella 2000&#34;</a> and <a href="http://www.petitesondes.net/Epoca/1982-1655-p.pdf">&#34;Epoca&#34;</a>. For the title font (&#34;Akilines&#34;) I took inspiration from &#34;Mecanorma Graphic Book no. 9, catalog 1980&#34;, a font manual that preserves all the styles most used in the 80s.
                          The article with the largest photograph, usually, was distinguished from the others in importance, consequently also the font of its title was greater and the brightest. The other articles were paginated at the edges of the page with smaller images. The purpose of a layout of this type was exactly to attract the reader and strike his curiosity.
                          The background is of pure fantasy, however it recalls typical patterns of the 80s.
                        </p>


                            <h4>Articles - About - Documentation</h4>
                              <p>The internal layout of the magazines of the 80s included the use of double-edged or patterned frames, each with a different margin and thickness.
                              The font for the title of the articles was large and took up a lot of space on the page. We chose to use a heavy font because it was the style used mostly by &#34;Novella 2000&#34; and &#34;Epoca&#34;.Subtitles generally were smaller and in italic. The metadata of the article are represented between two black lines above and below, stacked at the beginning of the article. We were inspired by the magazine &#34;Il Sale. Weekly of satire,opinions, politics and second thoughts&#34; (Year 1 – no. 3, 1982, June 9th). All the information relating to the title, subtitle and columns is taken from the manual A. Hohenegger, Graphic Design, 5th edition, Romana Libri Alfabeto, 1980, &#34;La rivista&#34;.
                              The page of a magazine is generally divided into two, three four and, in some cases, 5 columns (for large formats). Considering the length of the texts, we chose to use 2 columns. The large margin between the columns was chosen to respect the style philosophy of this historical period. The font for the text of the articles is Times New Roman as used by most of the magazines consulted, including &#34;Epoca&#34;, &#34;Oggi&#34; (Year XXXVIII – N.2, 13-1-1982 and N.5, 3-2-1982), &#34;Panorama&#34; (Year XXV - N.1103, 1987, June 7th), &#34;Il Sale&#34; (Year 1 – N.3, 198, June 9th), &#34;L&apos;illustrazione italiana&#34; (Year III - N.9, 1983, February-March). The first letter of the articles differs from the text by font and size. 
                              Spans are of invention but reflect the style of the historical period because they are enclosed between two black lines and the text is in italic as they used to highlight citations or important parts.
                              In the magazines of the 80s there were different formats for photographs: they could be rectangular, round, oval or have particular shapes. They were inserted into the columns of the articles, and could occupy two or more columns, an entire page or even two pages. In the articles proposed in this work it is not possible to extend the images on multiple columns because it is impossible to predict and control the overlap of images.
                              The style of the tables is taken from the computer magazine &#34;Nuova Elettronica&#34; (Year 21 - N. 129, March 1989) and have alternately white and blue rows with black header.</p>

                  <h3>2040</h3>
                  
                  <p>&#34;As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fasters reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. 
                  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down.
                  How did this happen?&#34; (Idiocracy, 2006)</p>

                  <p>The larger the human population grows, the average human I.Q. seems to drop. How can this happen even if we have all these technological advances? Even though we have much more social media and technology. How is this possible? 
                  Recent studies conducted on the I.Q. of the world population have revealed that the average I.Q. is decreasing very quickly 
                  (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/13/health/falling-iq-scores-study-intl/index.html">&#34;IQ scores are falling and have been for decades, new study findsv&#34;</a>; <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2730791/Are-STUPID-Britons-people-IQ-decline.html">&#34;Are we becoming more stupid? IQ scores are decreasing&#34;</a>).
                  Considering these results, we’ve hypothesized a negative web environment in the future. If the I.Q. level is decreasing so rapidly, in 2040 there will be no one interested in information and in reading the news, so nobody will be interested in spreading it through the web.
                  Probably in 2040 there will be only a few nostalgic of web-news that will create websites with the only purpose of having fun with old technology, with a strong reference to the graphics of the 90s.</p>

                  <p>For the style of 2040, we took inspiration from Brutalism (<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/brutalism-brutalist-websites.html">awwwards.com</a>; <a href="https://codepen.io/brianhaferkamp/post/brutalism-isn-t-the-absence-of-modernity">codepen.io</a>; <a href="https://www.uxbrutalism.com/">uxbrutalism.com</a>; <a href="https://www.ilpost.it/2016/05/13/siti-brutti-brutalismo/">ilpost.it</a>; <a href="https://www.html.it/03/03/2017/brutalist-web-design-il-trend-che-non-trova-freni/">html.it</a>). Usability? Legibility? Common sense? Forget everything you know about good practice of web design. In 2040 we will be in the Brutalist Era.
                  The nowadays web design is characterized by the prevailing minimalism, often chosen as an elegant and essential proposal to present a product or to make navigation easy. Brutalism is a more extreme current than minimalism, almost in contrast.
                  It was rapidly growing trend of 2017, made up of &#34;rough&#34; sites, reduced to the bone, where text games are predominant and where apparently extraneous graphic elements can coexist. A raw current inspired by the architectural brutality of the XX century, at least at the level of concept, designed to create an unexpected aesthetic alternative to the mainstream web design standards. All focusing on both the surprise effect and unpleasant but at the same time fascinating elements. 
                  Brutalist websites have elementary and chaotic graphics, dominated by text games, artistic and disruptive interaction of images and illustrations, where there is no universal concept of beauty.
                  Brutalism isn&apos;t an absence of modernity. It is the absence of a modern aesthetic. It merely shows what is normally hidden beneath the gleaming facade. It can be seen as a reaction to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity.
                  Brutalism is against rationalism, functionality and usability. It can be defined as freestyle ugly irreverent raw and superficially decorative.
                  Brutalist websites are not prehistorical things that can only use HTML. Rather, they embrace structural CSS and JavaScript.
                  The first step is to throw elements on the screen, without worrying too much about how they work together. Who are you to define hierarchy anyway? Let each element fight for the spotlight.
                  The secret to great brutalist is contrast and irregularity. Some elements of brutalism include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Non-system (web-safe) fonts</li>
                          <li>Images with filters, blurs, etc. in the weirdest and most uncomfortable of places</li>
                          <li>Giant cursor </li>
                          <li>Excessive use of hover effects</li>
                          <li>Micro interactions</li>
                          <li>Unusability</li>
                          <li>Users unfriendly practices</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                       <h4>Homepage</h4>
                        <p>In the homepage, each element is designed to create, at first glance, a sense of surprise, discomfort and confusion in the user. The title in motion, the shape of a viewfinder of the cursor, links that change position every time you pass over it and the animated background take inspiration from video games of the 90s and from pixel art.
                         The fonts and colors chosen for the homepage are the result of a research on the worst chromatic and textual combinations, in order to visually disturb the user and create disgust. Some examples are: yellow text on green background, red text on violet background or purple text on orange background. All together it is like a game in which the user is called to actively participate in first person.</p>
                        

                      <h4>Articles - About - Documentation</h4>
                        
                          <p>In the sections &#34;Articles&#34;, &#34;About&#34; and &#34;Documentation&#34;, there is a animated gradient background, with variations of shades from violet to blue, passing through fuchsia and red. The color of the font in the title and text is always yellow, which on each shade is particularly difficult to read. Noteworthy is the text font, Comic Sans: &#34;If you love it, you don&apos;t know much about typography, if you hate it, you really don&apos;t know much about typography, either, and you should get another hobby.&#34; (Vincent Connare, creator of Comic Sans)The reference is to the disproportionate use of it that was made in the 90s and early 2000s.
                          The cursor is a giant hand that turns into an arrow when it passes over links, which increase their size.
                          The images are apparently positioned in such a way as to guarantee a fluent reading but passing over them with the cursor, they increase size and cover part of the text and the caption. Even the font color of the caption and background are not random: acid green on a pink background are bad color match and cause eye strain.
                          The spans of the articles are in continuous movement, with a flow from right to left, which it is possible to stop passing over with the cursor. For the EU Directive article the spans are fixed and glow.
                          The article tables alternatively include row with red and blue backgrounds, and blue and red fonts respectively. Passing over with the cursor, the cell color turns into green.</p>
