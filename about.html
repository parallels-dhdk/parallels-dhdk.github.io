        The overall purpose of the Paralles Project is to create several word-switchable themes that are historically accuratea nd sufficiently generic to be applicable to any type of document, including more modern ones.
        Every detail, from the font family and size to the colors, from the margins to the aspect ratio, from the page size to the images and the captions, are designed to exactly remind the reader of a specific hystorical design style. 
        Our project support the following html tags: article, section, p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, ul, ol, li, a, span, img, figcaption, table, td, th, tr, div,. The only prerogative is that the document should be inserted between the article tag and divided in section of equal or similar lenght. 
        This project has been implemented by Sara Armaroli, Lucia Giagnolini and Michela Parma for &#34;Information modelling and web technologies&#34; examinatination, University of Bologna. Paralles, the name we chose for the project, refers to the seventh season of Star Trek - The next generation, ep. 11, in which Worf contuously pass from one time line (?) to the other, until the space is filled with Enterprise belonging to the multiple quantum temporal variants.
